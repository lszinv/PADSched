Application to convert Dungeon times from JP timezone (obtained from pazunet) to device local time zone.

------------

This application is designed as an accompanying tool for the mobile game Puzzles & Dragons.
I play this game on my android phone and was always checking event times for the game from Japanese sites, and having to do a timezone conversion to local time to figure out when events were happening. 

So to save myself the trouble of needing to open my browser and also figuring the times out (especially with the changes from daylight savings) I decided to just create an app to handle it all for me.
I then added automatic notification feature to spawn a notification when specific events were happening, that could be set by the user in the app.

The primary function of this application was for personal use, but was published onto the play store on the chance that any other English players playing on the Japanese servers were to find it useful.
